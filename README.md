# Wine Quality Prediction Model

**Machine learning-based wine quality prediction model**




## Acknowledgement

As social drinking becomes more popular, the wine business has seen a recent boom. Wine's pricing is determined by a very vague idea of wine appreciation among wine tasters. To some extent, wine pricing is influenced by this fluctuating aspect. We look at a number of white wine types and their chemical features, as well as taster rankings.

Physicochemical tests, which are laboratory-based and take into consideration parameters like acidity, pH level, presence of sugar, and other chemical qualities, are another important aspect in wine certification and quality evaluation. For the wine market, it would be interesting if human testing quality could be linked to the chemical qualities of wine, allowing for a more regulated certification, quality evaluation, and assurance procedure. One dataset (whitewine v2.xls) is provided, which contains 4710 kinds of white wine. All wines are made in a specific region of Portugal. Data is gathered on 12 distinct attributes of the wines, one of which is Quality (i.e. the last column), which is based on sensory data, while the others are chemical properties such as density, acidity, and alcohol level.

All of a wine's chemical qualities are continuous variables. Quality is an ordinal variable having a range of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) (best). Each wine variety is sampled by three independent tasters, with the final rank determined by the tasters' median score.
